# C# Tasks on Text and Array Processing

This project contains solutions to four programming tasks implemented in **C#**.  
The tasks focus on **text analysis** and **array data processing**, covering operations such as digit extraction from strings and statistical evaluations over arrays.

## Task 1: Sum and Maximum of Digits in Text

**Description:**  
Given a string that contains digits, perform the following:

- **(a)** Calculate the **sum** of all digits in the text.  
- **(b)** Determine the **maximum digit** found in the text.

---

## Task 2: Position of the Largest Digit (Ignoring Leading Spaces)

**Description:**  
Given a string that may contain leading spaces and digits, determine the **position (1-based index)** of the **first occurrence** of the **largest digit**, starting the count from the **first non-space character**.

> If there are multiple digits equal to the maximum, return the position of the **first one** only.

## Task 3: Find the Thickest Book

**Description:**  
Given an array of integers representing the number of pages in **100 books** (assuming each page has the same thickness), determine how many pages are in the **thickest book**.

## Task 4: Find the Fastest Car(s)

**Description:**  
Given an array of integers representing the **maximum speed (in mph)** of **40 car brands**, perform the following:

- Determine the **index (1-based)** of the **fastest car**.
- If multiple cars have the same maximum speed:
  - **(a)** Return the position of the **first** one.
  - **(b)** Return the position of the **last** one.
